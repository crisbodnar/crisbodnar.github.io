I am a final year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science, University of Cambridge, supervised by
[Prof Pietro Liò](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/). My research uses applied Topology and Differential Geometry for analysing and developing machine learning models suitable for spaces with non-Euclidean structure. Within this area, I am particularly interested in graph representation learning. 

In support of my research activity, I was awarded a [Microsoft Research PhD Fellowship](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/phd-fellowship/#!people) (2021). I've also spent significant time in industry as a research intern at Microsoft Research (2022), [Twitter Cortex](https://cortex.twitter.com/) (2021), Google Brain (2020), and as an AI Resident at Google X (2019). In 2019, I graduated with distinction the MPhil in Advanced Computer Science at Cambridge with a Best MPhil Student Award. Previously, I did my undergraduate studies at The University of Manchester (UK) with an [award-winning](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/multiple-successes-for-manchester-undergrads-at-worlds-most-prestigious-student-awards/) research dissertation supervised 
by [Dr Jonathan Shapiro](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~jls/). My Erdős number is 3.
