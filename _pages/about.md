Hi there! My name is Cris, and I am a third-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science, University of Cambridge, supervised by
[Prof Pietro Liò](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/). My research uses applied Topology and Differential Geometry for analysing and developing machine learning models suitable for spaces with non-Euclidean structure. Within this area, I am particularly interested in graph representation learning. 

In support of my research activity, I was awarded a [Microsoft Research PhD Fellowship](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/phd-fellowship/#!people) (2021). I've also spent significant time in industry as a research intern at Microsoft Research (2022), [Twitter Cortex](https://cortex.twitter.com/) (2021), Google Brain (2020), and as an AI Resident at Google X (2019). In 2019, I graduated with distinction the MPhil in Advanced Computer Science at Cambridge with a Best MPhil Student Award. Previously, I did my undergraduate studies at The University of Manchester (UK) with an [award-winning](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/multiple-successes-for-manchester-undergrads-at-worlds-most-prestigious-student-awards/) research dissertation supervised 
by [Dr Jonathan Shapiro](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~jls/). My Erdős number is 3.

### 2022

- **July: I was a lecturer at the [First Italian Summer School of Geometric Deep Learning](https://www.sci.unich.it/geodeep2022/) alongside Michael Bronstein, Francesco Di Giovanni, Pim de Haan and Maurice Weiler. My lectures cover a large part of my upcoming PhD thesis on Topological Deep Learning and argue why topology should play a central role in GDL. The [recordings](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn2-dEmQeTfRQXLKf9Fmlk3HmReGg3YZZ) and the [slides](https://www.sci.unich.it/geodeep2022/#schedule) are available online.**
- July: I will be a mentoring a [research project on Sheaf Neural Networks](https://www.logml.ai/people/mentor22/cristian) at the [London Geometry and Machine Learning Summer School](https://www.logml.ai/). If you are interested to work with me on this topic, please apply on the summer school website. 
- June: We wrote a blogpost about [Topological Message Passing](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-new-computational-fabric-for-graph-neural-networks-280ea7e3ed1a) and [Neural Sheaf Diffusion](https://towardsdatascience.com/neural-sheaf-diffusion-for-deep-learning-on-graphs-bfa200e6afa6) 
- May: Famous ML YouTuber Aleksa Gordić made a [video explaining our Neural Sheaf Diffusion paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiQmkhsbRwk) and including lots of nice intuitions of sheaf theory. 
- Feb: New preprint - [Neural Sheaf Diffusion: A Topological Perspective on Heterophily and Oversmoothing in GNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04579). I gave a talk about the paper on the 8th of March at [Sorbonne Université](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en/events/workshop-recent-advances-graph-machine-learning), followed by another talk on the 11th of March in the Department of Mathematics, University of Oxford. The slides can be found [here](https://crisbodnar.github.io/talks/).
- Jan: I was featured alongside many prominent
Graph ML researchers in an [ample blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/predictions-and-hopes-for-geometric-graph-ml-in-2022-aa3b8b79f5cc) by Michael Bronstein and Petar Veličković, which aims to review and predict the new directions in the field. 

### 2021

- Nov: [Weisfeiler and Lehman Go Cellular](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12575) was accepted as an oral presentation to the [ELLIS ML for Molecule Discovery Workshop](https://moleculediscovery.github.io/workshop2021/).
- Oct: I have been awarded a [Microsoft Research PhD Fellowship](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/phd-fellowship/#!people). 
- Sept: [Weisfeiler and Lehman Go Cellular: CW Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12575) has been accepted to NeurIPS 2021. We obtain SOTA results on molecular benchmarks using cell complexes. 
- Sept: I've joined Twitter as a research intern to work on Topological & Geometric Deep Learning with [Michael Bronstein](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/m.bronstein) and the Cortex team. 
- April: [Weisfeiler and Lehman Go Topological: Message Passing Simplicial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03212) was accepted as a short talk to ICML 2021. Previously, the paper was accepted as a spotlight presentation to the [Geometrical and Topological Representation Learning](https://gt-rl.github.io/) workshop at ICLR 2021. 
- Feb: [Neural ODE Processes](https://openreview.net/forum?id=27acGyyI1BY) was accepted as a poster to ICLR 2021. 

### 2020

- May: I have been awarded the [Leathersellers' Graduate Scholarship](https://www.fitz.cam.ac.uk/college-life/fees-funding-and-awards/postgraduate-scholarships-and-prizes) by Fitzwilliam College and The Leathersellers' Company, one of the ancient Livery Companies of the City of London. The scholarship is awarded to four students each year for excellence in Physical or Biological Sciences, Engineering or Mathematics.
