Hi there! I am a Senior Researcher at Microsoft Research in the [AI4Science team](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-ai4science/) where I am working at intersection of deep learning and partial differential equations (PDEs). On the ML side, my research spans a range of topics such as geometric & topological deep learning, graph neural networks and neural differential equations.

Previously, I finished my PhD at the University of Cambridge, supervised by
[Prof Pietro Li√≤](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/) and supported by a [Microsoft Research PhD Fellowship](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/phd-fellowship/#!people) (2021). I've also spent significant time in industry as a research intern at Microsoft Research (2022), [Twitter Cortex](https://cortex.twitter.com/) (2021), Google Brain (2020), and as an AI Resident at [Google X](https://x.company/) (2019). In 2019, I graduated with distinction the MPhil in Advanced Computer Science at Cambridge with a Best MPhil Student Award.
